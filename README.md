About This Release:

Web Performance System 1.0.2 is both a product and a service developed and delivered by Ginsbourg.com. It offers continuous visibility into the availability and user experience of business oriented websites and web applications. Running as a background process or on any standard display, the Web Performance System (WPS) provides IT teams with critical alerts, performance metrics, and scheduled reports. It enables identification and immediate response to a very wide set of pre-defined conditions to guarantee a highly positive customer and end-user experience.

WPS can be configured to run in the desired frequency (be it once a minute, once an hour or daily), 24x7. It launches any JMETER script of any virtual user type without adding a noticeable load to the monitored websites and web applications. The ultimate goal of Ginsbourg.com is to deliver a powerful and reliable platform to allow IT teams continuous monitoring and control of their systems. Optionally, scripts that have already been prepared for load testing, and previously used for validating the performance of the websites and web applications, can now be reused for ongoing performance monitoring.

WPS currently runs on a virtual machine that can be played on any existing hardware, virtual host, or cloud. WPS sends alerts by email for any deviation from the required Service Level Agreement (SLA). Daily performance reports are also available by mail and optional SMS.

With WPS, you control the availability of your websites and web applications, to provide optimal efficiency and customer satisfaction.
